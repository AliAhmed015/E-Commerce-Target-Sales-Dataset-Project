# Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves comprehensive data analysis using SQL and Python to extract insights from a dataset. The aim was to explore customer orders, sales, and product information, providing valuable business insights through various SQL queries and visualizations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Dataset**: A CSV file containing customer order information, available for download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv).
2. **Data Import**: The dataset was imported into SQL using the Jupyter Notebook file `importing_csv_to_sql.ipynb`.
3. **SQL Queries**: A series of SQL queries were executed to answer specific analytical questions.
4. **Visualizations**: Python was used to create visual representations of the data, enhancing understanding and insights.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and calculations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced statistical graphics.
- **mysql.connector**: For connecting to the MySQL database.

## Questions Addressed

### Basic Queries
1. List all unique cities where customers are located.
2. Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
3. Find the total sales per category.
4. Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
5. Count the number of customers from each state.

### Intermediate Queries
1. Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
2. Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
3. Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
4. Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
5. Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller and rank them by revenue.

### Advanced Queries
1. Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
2. Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.
3. Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
4. Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
5. Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. Open the `importing_csv_to_sql.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to import the dataset into SQL.
4. Execute the SQL queries to retrieve the desired insights.
5. Use the provided Python scripts to visualize the data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of SQL and Python for data analysis, providing meaningful insights from customer order data. Feel free to explore the code and modify it for your own analysis!
